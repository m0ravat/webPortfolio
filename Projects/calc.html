            This project was an extension on my first coursework done at university. Originally, it was done in 
            python but due to the nature of the project I couldn't make the code open on GitHub, so to show my skills 
            I decided to take it further by going from a basic program that determines if you pass/fail to a calculator that can 
            do basic arithmetic, and determine the outcome of an undergraduate student.

            This original projects language used was python, which I first coded in the Python IDE, switching to visual studio code for 
            ease. It included the use of basic concepts like passing parameters through functions, exception handling, 
            combining If/Else statements with loops and storing data in a list/text file. I then created a more advanced calculator 
            in HTML/CSS/JS using Visual studio Code, which was focused on string manipulation and input validation. The arithmetic 
            calculator was made responsive for ease of use. 
        </p>

    <div class="container wrap width" id="process">
        <h1 class="title">Process</h1>
        <p>
            The process for making the code was originally I began in python IDE, but after frustration switched to visual 
            studio code. The project was rather simple as it was just combining basic aspects like loops, iteration, and exception 
            handling. However, it also forced us to take into account graphics and validation, which makes you think about the user. <br> <br>
            The calculator project done in HTML/CSS/JS started off with an arithmetic calculator, which involved string manipulation 
            for the purpose of combining operators, numbers and a decimal point in one statement. I focused heavily on input 
            validation to ensure outliers or misinputs (ie. putting one operator after another - '+/ ') were dealt with. 
            I stored the current and previous number (if applicable) into variables, occasioanlly using the parseFloat() to 
            find the outcome. 
            <br> As for the calculator to find the grade of a student, it included the use of storing values in an array and outputting it, 
            and also making sure all relevant parts were filled out.

            Overall, I would say I enjoyed working with python, as the syntax was rather easy and straight forward. Programming 
            a similar project in HTML/CSS/JS proved a challenge as I had to account for the user interface, I couldn't simply
            handle it in a console. This meant I had to constantly validate the buttons entered. Also having to refer to the elements instead 
            of just using variables in python proved tedious, but I would say I am more confident in my web programming skills now.
