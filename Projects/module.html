            This was my first project in university, and as such I am unable to disclose specifics. However, I can say this was 
            a very pleasant experience as I was challenged to combine many procedural programming aspects together. The general aim
            of this was to take in a mark and generate a given output. I am hoping to extend on this in the near future by 
            creating a more broad calculator app so be on the lookout!

            This section will be more focused on python, which was the language used. I would say using Visual Studio code 
            made programming alot easier as with the python IDE it doesn't generate alot of syntax contextually. This can make 
            coding tedious and find it annoying when finding little errors.

        <h1 class="title">Process</h1>
        <p>
            The process for making the code was originally I began in python IDE, but after frustration switched to visual 
            studio code. The project was rather simple as it was just combining basic aspects like loops, iteration, and exception 
            handling. However, it also forced us to take into account graphics and validation, which makes you think about the user.

            Overall, I would say I enjoyed working with python, but over half a year I would prefer java at ths base, due to
            its cleaner code. However, python is a very beginner friendly language and I feel it helped me brush up and master 
            certain areas I struggled in during college.
