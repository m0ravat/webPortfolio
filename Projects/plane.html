        <h1 class="title">Summary</h1>
        <p>This was a project that is based off making a booking system for a plane, where the user can buy seats. This 
            utilises object oriented programming techniques learnt along with other basic concepts like
            exception handling, loops, switch-case statements etc. It was launched on Netbeans and included the use of two 
            classes - one for handling the persons information and the other for the seat. Currently, I have only 
            programmed it in Java but be on the lookout as I hope to implement it into JavaScript in the future.

            This was issued as a coursework in university and as such had many tasks to complete, ranging from simple tasks 
            which included looping over all seats, or changing the status of one specific seat. Due to the nature of the 
            project I can't go into specifics beyond that. This project forced me to have to take things one step at a time, 
            which I did by focusing on each respective section first.

        <p>
            The process was rather simple, as I started off by creating an array for the seats and then I created the subroutines 
            to carry out certain tasks on it. I then proceeded to create classes for the tickets so I can store seat data, and 
            a person class to store the persons information. The trickiest part was having to combine multiple aspects 
            of object oriented programming alongside the basic procedural programming concepts I learnt the previous 
            semester.

        <p>
            To conclude, I feel this was an eye opener for me. It showed me how when programming you have to account for 
            multiple classes at once, similar to tables in databases and how they interact with one another. It also 
            helped me work on learning how to prioritise certain tasks at time so you can finish the project efficiently. This 
            project also made java my favourite langauge, as I enjoyed how consistent the syntax for the language is. While it 
            may look more tedious than python it stops you writing messy code and makes it easy to remember the format
            as everything is accounted for, whether by curly brackets, brackets or simply ending a line in a semi colon.
