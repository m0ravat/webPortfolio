        <p>
            This is for my website you are currently on. After my first year of university ended I realised me web programming was 
            very weak compared to my proficiency in Java and Python, so I undertook this challenging project to improve my skills and 
            showcase them for prospective employers. This has by far been my longest project, and challenged me in many ways ,
            especially when considering making the interface nice to look at.

    <div class="container wrap width" id="analysis">
        <h1 class="title">Analysis</h1>
        <p>
            I first began by looking at various portfolio website examples online for inspiration, and took alot of it from 
            <a href="https://www.hostinger.co.uk/tutorials/web-developer-portfolio">here.</a> I started off by deciding to make 
            a home page, about me page, projects page and contact page to prevent the website from becoming too long. It also helped 
            make the code look cleaner by putting it on different HTML files, for my sake. I also added a navbar, with a hide menu option 
            and dark mode option which uses basic JavaScript. I also included a custom cursor and theme option bottom left for customisability 
            and to show off some more basic JavaScript skills. Recently, I added a section at the bottom also as a sitemap, for easy 
            navigation throughout the site. The about me page had me use my HTML/CSS skills to create my general resume in a more 
            readable form. It helped me in practicing formatting divs and basic styling, as the icons at first became tedious. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container wrap width" id="process">
        <h1 class="title">Process</h1>
        <p>
            This project forced me to use many elements and styling techniques, including combining classes. At this point my JavaScript 
            is mainly built up of basic statements that manipulate certain styling, and uses many switch-case and if/else statements. 
            I also used the practice of flexboxes which I picked up on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project.</a>
            I also used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> to follow up. I also practiced efficient file formatting to make 
            readability easier and seperated certain styling in my CSS file to navigate quickly, preventing the need for multiple CSS files.
            I also used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts, </a> <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons">Google Icons, </a> 
            and <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> for some other icons. My choice of IDE was Visual Studio Code
        </p>

    <div class="container wrap width" id="reflection">
        <h1 class="title">Reflection</h1>
        <p>
            On reflection, I would definitely say this project helped me, in my skills from consideration of the user's experience
            to designing the look of a web page. This also helped me improve my web programming skills, and has thus given me 
            the confidence to make websites. I would say my next obstacle would be to consider responsiveness, as my website is 
            very poorly equipped for mobile users, and I should soon consider moving on to using frameworks in the future.
